                            The acronym NFT refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" class="blog__content-link">Non-Fungible Token</a>, which explains almost everything. As the crypto sphere begins to boom towards 2021, NFTs have already gained popularity. The piece of artwork shown is an NFT, as well as it was recently marketed for $60 million. Mike Winkelmann, better known by his pen name Beeple, produced digital art creation. It is a digital representation of all works of art he had created from 2013. Surprisingly, Everyday’s actual selling rate is set at a pitiful $110 beginning February 25th. Twenty buyers boosted the value to almost $1.2 million in the first nine minutes of bidding. The price range was rough, $15 million one hour, even before the auction concluded. The price has risen to $30 million in the last ten minutes only. The final price was established at $60.30 million, an additional $10 million for the Christie’s artwork sale, in the dying seconds.
